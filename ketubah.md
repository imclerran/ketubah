# Ketubah

On Friday, the 6th day of Sivan, 5783 according to the Hebrew calendar and the 26th day of May, 2023 according to the Gregorian calendar, in the county of Chelan, Leigh Giorgianni and Ian McLerran confirm in the presence of witnesses a lovers' covenant between them and declare a partnership to establish a household among the people of YHWH.

The agreement into which Ian and Leigh are entering is a holy covenant like the ancient covenants of our people, made in faithfulness and peace to stand forever.

It is a covenant of grace, like God's covenant to send a Savior to right the wrongs of the world:
```
"“I am YHWH; I have called you in righteousness; I will take you by the hand and keep you;
I will give you as a covenant for the people, a light for the nations,
to open the eyes that are blind, to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon,
from the prison those who sit in darkness."" (Isaiah 42:6-7)"
```
It is a covenant of protection like the covenant YHWH swore to Israel, saying:
```
"Fear not, for I have redeemed you; I have called you by name, you are mine. When you pass through the waters, I will be with you; and through the rivers, they shall not overwhelm you; when you walk through fire you shall not be burned,
and the flame shall not consume you. For I am YHWH your God, the Holy One of Israel, your Savior. (Isaiah 43:1-3)"
```
It is a covenant of blessing like the covenant YHWH swore to Abraham, saying:
```
I will make a great nation of you, and I will bless you and make your name great. I will bless those who bless you, and whoever dishonors you I will curse. All the families of the earth shall be blessed through you. (Genesis 12:2-3)
```
It is a covenant of distinction, like the covenant YHWH made with Israel, saying:
```
You shall be My people, and I shall be your God. (Jer. 32:38)
```
It is a covenant of devotion, of knitting together souls like the covenant between David and Jonathan, as it is said:
```
And the soul of Jonathan was knit to the soul of David, and Jonathan loved him as his own soul... And Jonathan made a covenant with David because he loved him as his own soul. (1 Sam. 18:1,3)
```
It is a covenant of service, like the covenant YHWH made with David, to serve David rather than be served:
```
"""Would you build me a house to dwell in? I have not lived in a house since the day I brought up the people of Israel from Egypt to this day, but I have been moving about in a tent for my dwelling....
```
```
I will make for you a great name, like the name of the great ones of the earth. And I... will make you a house... And your house and your kingdom shall be established before me forever.” (2 Samuel 7:5-16, excerpts)"
```
It is a covenant of intimacy like the wedding covenant between God and Zion, as it is said:
```
“In that day,” declares YHWH, “you will call me 'my husband'; you will no longer call me ‘my lord….' I will betroth you to me forever. I will betroth you to me with righteousness and justice and lovingkindness and compassion. I will betroth you to me in faithfulness and you shall know YHWH. (Hos. 2:16; 19-20)
```
It is a covenant of exclusivity as is written in Song of Songs,
```
Set me as a seal upon your heart,
as a seal upon your arm,
for love is strong as death,
jealousy is fierce as the grave.
Song of Songs 8:6a
```
```
Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him, and he with me.
Revelation 3:20
```
Provisions of the Covenant

The following are the provisions of the lovers' covenant into which Ian son of Dale and Leigh and daughter of Thomas now enter:

1. Ian and Leigh commit themselves to a life of kindness and righteousness as a Messianic family, to minister to one another in pursuit of shalom - emotionally, physically, psychologically, and spiritually, and to work together toward the communal task of mending the world by the grace of YHWH in Yeshua, the Messiah, through the Holy Spirit.

2. Ian and Leigh pledge to comfort, defend, and protect each other through all trial, illness, and distress. Ian and Leigh vow that one will help the other at the time of dying, by carrying out the last rational requests of the dying partner, protecting the beloved from indignity or abandonment and by tender, faithful presence with the beloved until the end.

3. Ian and Leigh promise to bless each other: they will honor each other, build each other up, speak well of each other, share ideas with each other, and seek one another's best interests in all things. Ian and Leigh hereby assume all the rights and obligations that apply to family members: to abide with, attend to, care for, and provide for one another and for any children with whom they may be blessed.

4. Ian and Leigh declare that they have chosen each other as companions and pledge to prefer and esteem each other distinctly above all peers and rivals for their passions and attention.

5. Ian and Leigh vow to love each other in gentleness even as their own souls. They promise that their speech, touch, and time will reflect lovingkindness towards one another.

6. Ian and Leigh pledge to surrender to one another, meet one another's needs, fulfill one another's desires, and serve one another in any way they can. They pledge to place one another's needs above their own.

7. Ian and Leigh commit to a life of unity with one another and with YHWH - that they may be one as Yeshua is one with the Father. Together they pledge to live, eat, pray, spend time in devotions, care for family, serve their community, share their hearts, knowledge, and resources, discuss life's issues, and make decisions - as one. 

8. Ian and Leigh declare that they have set themselves apart for each other and will take no other lover, in mind, heart, or body, committing themselves to a rich life of intimacy with each other exclusively. They vow to never forsake each other for another - not with their bodies, nor with their hearts, nor with their eyes.

To this covenant we affix our signatures.
